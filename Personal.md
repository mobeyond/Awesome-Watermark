Due respect to all contributors list or unlisted here, I'd like to recommend only 1 formal python project which can be installed directly by one command:
$pip install invisible-watermark
,which is believed to be a repository here by SheldMnt in:    https://github.com/ShieldMnt/invisible-watermark

But for neural network implementation, I'd like to recommend Facebook(Meta) research's work, which can be found in the companion repository here:
https://github.com/mobeyond/watermark-freedom
forked from https://github.com/facebookresearch/watermark-anything
